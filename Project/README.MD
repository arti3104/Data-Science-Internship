Project Title - CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

Description - 
The project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service, such
as a telecommunications company, using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the
phenomenon where customers discontinue their subscription or stop using the service. By identifying 
customers at risk of churn, the company can take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering 
incentives or personalized promotions.
